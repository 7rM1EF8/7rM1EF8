After graduating as a Telecommunications Engineer, I joined the French army to become an officer.

Upon leaving the army, I went back to IT, and chose the cybersecurity field, in which I have always had an interest.

I soon joined the SOC of one of the biggest manufacturing companies in the world, and had incredible opportunities there to work on hardening, incident handling, incident response on major incidents both live and post mortem, forensics, and even a few cases of criminal activities.

Between the excitement of these major incidents, I mostly worked on improving detection capabilities, and on building an MSSP SOC (people, tools and procedures).

Since then, SOC building, MSSP or regular, and detection capabilities improvement have been my main focuses, because I have realized the incredible security potential in SOCs, and how badly under-exploited it usually is.
